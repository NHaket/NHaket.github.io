## About Me

Hi! I’m Nina Haket, a PhD student at the University of Cambridge, supervised by Prof. Kasia Jaszczolt. My research focuses on conceptual engineering, word meaning, and language change, with a particular emphasis on the relationship between philosophy and linguistics. Before this, I completed a Research Master’s in Linguistics at Leiden University and a Bachelor’s in Linguistcs at the University of Cambridge. My work combines theoretical linguistics with corpus analysis, and I’m particularly interested in the semantics-pragmatics interface and its role in language change.

## Research Interests

Areas of specialisation:  Conceptual Engineering, Language Change, Semantics-Pragmatics Boundary,  Word Meaning

Areas of competence: Historical Linguistics, Sociolinguistics, Philosophy of Language
