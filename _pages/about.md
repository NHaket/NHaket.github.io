Hi! I’m Nina, a PhD student in Linguistics at the University of Cambridge, supervised by Prof. Kasia Jaszczolt. My research focuses on conceptual engineering and lexical semantics, exploring these notions through interdisciplinary methodologies. Before this, I completed a Research Master’s in Linguistics at Leiden University and a Bachelor’s in Linguistcs at the University of Cambridge. My work combines theoretical linguistics with corpus analysis, and I’m particularly interested in the semantics-pragmatics interface and its role in language change.
