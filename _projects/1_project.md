Imagine reshaping the world by redefining the very words we use to describe it. That’s the promise of Conceptual Engineering (CE): changing meanings to change minds—and, ultimately, society. For example, grounding the concept of **WOMAN** in social oppression rather than biology (Haslanger, 2000) isn’t just a philosophical shift—it’s a tool for justice.

My research dives deep into this transformative potential of CE, connecting philosophical insights with underexplored linguistic frameworks to uncover how words influence—and are influenced by—their contexts. In essence, I’m investigating how meaning can be leveraged to drive real-world change.

## Words Aren’t Everything

Contrary to some assumptions in CE literature, the power of individual words isn’t as all-encompassing as it seems. Consider a mother reassuring her child with a cut, saying, "You’re not going to die." Clearly, this doesn’t mean the child becomes immortal (Bach, 1994). This illustrates that **meaning emerges not just from words themselves but from entire utterances and their interplay**. CE must adopt a broader, more holistic view, accounting for these layers of meaning to truly succeed.

## Mapping Meaning in Use

To tackle these complexities, my thesis blends theory with innovative methods. I explore spoken data to uncover nuances in word meaning often overlooked in CE, despite spoken language being our primary medium of communication. Using **contextualised word embeddings** created with **BERT** on the spoken component of the British National Corpus 2014 (Love et al., 2017), I construct **landscapes of meaning**—visual and quantitative representations of how word usage varies across contexts. These landscapes, based on cosine similarity measures, offer conceptual engineers a powerful tool to better understand their targets throughout the CE process.

## Implications

By weaving together multiple levels and units of meaning, I argue that CE must embrace these dynamic, interwoven layers to be truly effective. But the impact of this work reaches far beyond CE:

- **In diachronic linguistics**, it provides a granular framework to understand semantic change over time, moving beyond general trends to specific trajectories.
- **In sociolinguistics, anthropology, and philosophy**, it begins to explore how human consciousness shapes semantic and societal shifts.
- **In Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, it offers a more comprehensive approach to variation in word usage, breaking free from the limitations of traditional word sense paradigms.

My work pushes the boundaries of what CE can achieve and opens new doors for understanding the intricate relationship between language, thought, and change. By navigating the spaces where meanings live and breathe, I aim to make words—and the world—a little more dynamic.
